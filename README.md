# PhonePadConverter

The "PhonePadConverter" project aims to tackle the challenge of converting old phone pad number input into alphabetical output. For example, given the input "222 2 22", the goal is to convert it to "CAB".

## Repository Contents

This repository contains two implementations of the solution:

1. **Main Branch**: The main branch contains a straightforward solution without any specific design patterns.
2. **Feature/Command_Pattern Branch**: The feature/command_pattern branch contains a solution implemented using the Command pattern, a design pattern used to encapsulate requests as objects, thus allowing for the parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.

## Project Structure

The solution is divided into two projects:

1. **PhonePadConverter**: This project contains the main code base for the challenge solution. It includes the implementation of the logic to convert phone pad number input to alphabetical output.
2. **PhonePadConverterTest**: This project is the unit test project, which contains test cases to ensure the correctness of the phone pad converter logic.

Both implementations, the one in the main branch and the one in the feature/command_pattern branch, can be found in the respective folders in the repository. The PhonePadConverter project is self-contained and can be run independently, while the PhonePadConverterTest project provides test cases to validate the correctness of the implemented solution.

Please note that this is just a brief overview of the project. More detailed documentation and code explanations may be available in the repository's codebase or accompanying documentation.
